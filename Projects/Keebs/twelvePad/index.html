        <p>I’ve wanted to build my own mechanical keyboard for a while now, and I think I’ve finally gathered enough knowledge and resources to try it out.
I’m going to start small with a simple number pad. I value a small form factor and simplicity, so first I need to design a layout that works for me.
The site I used to design the layout is (not suprisingly) <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/" title="layout editor website">www.keyboard-layout-editor.com</a>.
This is pretty much the standard for custom keyboards, and other tools will use the output of this program to aid in other aspects of the build, 
so starting here makes sense.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pad/layout.jpg" alt="Image of final layout" title="Image of layout" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/1d57b9caed0c38da67a4c6adc07e87d6" title="link to layout">This is the layout I ended up with</a>, and I have to say I really like it. It’s a simple 3x4 grid of 1u size keys, which is just enough to have all of
the numbers on the default layer, and one key left over which will be used to switch to the layer with the math symbols (along with return, delete, and num lock).</p>

<p>Once I know my layout, I can design the entire keyboard. I used the raw output of the layout editor in <a href="http://builder.swillkb.com/" title="link to builder site">this site</a> to generate CAD files of all of the
pieces that would make my keyboard. From here I sent the CAD for the switch plate to <a href="http://lasergist.com/" title="link to Lasergist">Lasergist</a> to get laser cut out of steel, and the rest of the
CAD files for the case went to <a href="https://www.ponoko.com/" title="link to Ponoko">Ponoko</a> for laser cutting out of acrylic.</p>

<p>Other components required for this project include switches (I went with MX blacks here), diodes (for anti-ghosting), wire, a teensy 2.0 micro controller, and a 
<a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=C2PXS-2406G-ND" title="teensy breakout">little breakout board that fits on the teensy</a> (digikey product #C2PXS-2406G-ND).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pad/IMG_20170406_212510.jpg" alt="all switches soldered into a matrix" title="Switches soldered" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Here we have all of the switches wired up in a matrix. The diodes are there to prevent ghosting.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pad/IMG_20170406_212537.jpg" alt="a look at the teensy microcontroller, here connected for testing" title="Teensy controller test" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The teensy is connected for testing.</p>

<p>now that i know the teensy works, I can solder it to the switches.</p>
