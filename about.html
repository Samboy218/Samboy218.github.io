        <p>I currently attend Tennessee Technological University studying Computer science with a concentration in Cyber Security. 
I’m in my senior year, and I’ll also be pursuing my masters as well.</p>

<p>I’m one of Tennessee’s first SFS Cybercorp scholars, more information about that program <a href="https://www.sfs.opm.gov/" title="link to sfs website">Here</a>, and if you’re interested in 
joining or learning more feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>I greatly enjoy programming, more for the fun of doing complex things and learning than anything else. 
C++ is my favorite language to code in; while some see it as overly pedantic and frustrating to use (and sometimes it is), 
I love the flexibility and precise control it gives me over my programs. 
In contrast, my second favorite language is python, for basically the opposite reasons I like C++. I enjoy the high levels of abstraction and 
quick, dirty programming style it offers. If I need to do something quick and I’m not concerned about high sophistication or performace, I’ll use python.</p>

<p>I also enjoy hardware level things. All through high school I spent a ton of my free time with a soldering iron in my hand. 
I’m by no means an expert, and I don’t consider myself to have a highly proficient knowledge of circuits and electricity, but I still enjoy making circuits.</p>

<p>I also do other things in my free time, mainly I play PC games (right now I’m on a Mount &amp; Blade kick), and I’m also an avid player of Magic: The Gathering.</p>
